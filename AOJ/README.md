Homework of the class about competitive programing 
In this class we made some algorithm problems in AOJ (http://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/)

--- About this class ---


First : introduction, how to do input and output, how to submit 

Second : I tried to solve the problem in dynamic programming but failed(taxrate.cc), full search is faster(taxrate1.cc).

Third : sort algorithms and greedy algorithms. I did two greedy algorithms' problems (country.cc and proncess.cc)

Fourth : I made longest common sequence (lcb.c). knapsack problem is popular so I tried it (knap.cc)

Fifth : Dynamic programming. I created Koch Curve algorithm (koch.cc)

Seventh : Various data structures. I created dictionary and priority queue (dic.cc and priority.cc). Then I created two problems that uses it. (robin.cc, rpolish.cc)

Eighth : Disjoint set and maximum spanning tree. (disjoint.cc and mst.cc)

Ninth : Breadth first search and graph (bfs.cc and graph.cc)

Tenth : Shortest path problems (carpenter.cc and shortest.cc) shortest.cc is known as Bellman-Ford algorithms

Eleventh : Judge whether a point is in a triangle (p_triangle.cc). Judge whether two lines are parallel (parallelism.cc). Calculate an area of polygons (polygon.cc and polygon2.cc).
