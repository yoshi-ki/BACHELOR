# BACHELOR
This repository contains code from projects I did in when I was an undergraduate. This README describes these projects in order of the time spent of them.

## CPU
I created CPU with my classmates. Code for the projects are in this directory. This core can be run on FPGA using our own ISA. This repository contains a compiler for our ISA.


## Compiler_Lab
This directory contains a code of compiler for min-caml, which is a subset of Ocaml. I leaned compiler system by creating a compiler.

## Basic_Algorithm
These are the code I wrote to learn basic programming skills and basic algorithms. I learned C and scheme. Besides, I mastered some algorithms using C, and created scheme processing system using scheme.

## Functional_Programming
I learned some characteristics of functional programming and logic programming (ex: monad), by creating programs for it. Besides, I played with functional programming by creating interpreter and Reversi program.

## Hardware
I learned hardware by creating some circuits using verilog. These codes are run on FPGA platform.

## Numerical_Analysis
I learned lots of numerical analysis algorithms and wrote code for it. I also learned tools for effectively executing code (ex: GPU, BLAS).

## is-cg
This directory contains class assignments for a computer graphics class.

## Statistical Machine Learning
This directory contains part of machine learning algorithms.

## Intelligence system
This repository contains code that I wrote in a class, "Intelligence system."

## AOJ
AOJ is a name of a programming contest site. This repository contains some solution for the problems in the web site. These are class assignments in a particular class.
